### Am I Responsive?

## UX

<a id=the-strategy>

### The Strategy

- My strategy centered around crafting an engaging and enjoyable Beatles quiz that would appeal to a broad audience.
- I aimed to go beyond the conventional question formats by incorporating music-related queries using Spotify.
- While initially considering the ambitious idea of recording Beatles songs in different styles, I acknowledged the current limitations of my JavaScript proficiency.

<a id=the-scope>

### The Scope

- Envisioning a unique Beatles quiz experience, I strived to offer more than just a standard set of questions.
- The incorporation of music questions, especially with Spotify integration, was a key aspect of my strategy.

- Although the aspiration to reimagine Beatles songs in various styles required advanced JavaScript skills, it remains a future prospect.

<a id=the-structure>

### The Structure

- To ensure the quiz's distinctiveness, I opted for three difficulty levels, each featuring diverse question types.
- The inclusion of a scoring system for each level aimed to provide users with a comprehensive assessment of their performance.

<a id=the-skeleton>

### The Skeleton

- For meticulous planning and visualization, I utilized Balsamiq to create wireframes.
- These wireframes served as a strategic guide, offering a clear blueprint for the quiz layout and design.

- [Wireframes Laptop](/documents/wireframes/laptop/)

<a id=the-surface>

### The Surface

- In the finalization phase, my strategy solidified with the decision to include 5 questions per difficulty level, each accompanied by a specific scoring system.
- The addition of a 10-second timer introduced an element of challenge.
- Inspired by the visual style of my previous project, I incorporated a background with opacity for a cohesive and visually appealing design.
- The project's foundation was laid by following a tutorial on YouTube, and proper credits to the tutorial creator were acknowledged.
- The strategic decision to embed a Beatles playlist aligns with the goal of making the quiz not just a test of knowledge but a holistic and enjoyable encounter for participants. This musical touch contributes to the immersive and entertaining nature of the game, fostering a connection with the iconic soundscape of The Beatles.

<a id=frequent-user>

### Frequent User

- Variety in Questions: Frequent users should encounter a diverse set of questions to maintain interest and prevent boredom.
