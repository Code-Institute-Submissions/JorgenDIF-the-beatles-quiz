## UX

<a id=the-strategy>

### The Strategy

  * My strategy centered around crafting an engaging and enjoyable Beatles quiz that would appeal to a broad audience.
   * I aimed to go beyond the conventional question formats by incorporating music-related queries using Spotify. 
   * While initially considering the ambitious idea of recording Beatles songs in different styles, I acknowledged the current limitations of my JavaScript proficiency.


<a id=the-scope>

### The Scope

* Envisioning a unique Beatles quiz experience, I strived to offer more than just a standard set of questions. 
* The incorporation of music questions, especially with Spotify integration, was a key aspect of my strategy. 

* Although the aspiration to reimagine Beatles songs in various styles required advanced JavaScript skills, it remains a future prospect.



<a id=the-structure>

### Th Structure

* To ensure the quiz's distinctiveness, I opted for three difficulty levels, each featuring diverse question types. 
* The inclusion of a scoring system for each level aimed to provide users with a comprehensive assessment of their performance.


<a id=the-skeleton>

### The Skeleton

* For meticulous planning and visualization, I utilized Balsamiq to create wireframes. 
* These wireframes served as a strategic guide, offering a clear blueprint for the quiz layout and design.
