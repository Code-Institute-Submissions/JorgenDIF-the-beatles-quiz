### Am I Responsive?

![Alt text](assets/images/ami-responsive-beatles.png)

<a id=ux>

## UX

<a id=the-strategy>

### The Strategy

- My strategy centered around crafting an engaging and enjoyable Beatles quiz that would appeal to a broad audience.
- I aimed to go beyond the conventional question formats by incorporating music-related queries using Spotify.
- While initially considering the ambitious idea of recording Beatles songs in different styles, I acknowledged the current limitations of my JavaScript proficiency.

<a id=the-scope>

### The Scope

- Envisioning a unique Beatles quiz experience, I strived to offer more than just a standard set of questions.
- The incorporation of music questions, especially with Spotify integration, was a key aspect of my strategy.

- Although the aspiration to reimagine Beatles songs in various styles required advanced JavaScript skills, it remains a future prospect.

<a id=the-structure>

### The Structure

- To ensure the quiz's distinctiveness, I opted for three difficulty levels, each featuring diverse question types.
- The inclusion of a scoring system for each level aimed to provide users with a comprehensive assessment of their performance.

<a id=the-skeleton>

### The Skeleton

- For meticulous planning and visualization, I utilized Balsamiq to create wireframes.
- These wireframes served as a strategic guide, offering a clear blueprint for the quiz layout and design.

- [Wireframes Iphone](/documents/wireframes/ipad/)
- [Wireframes Ipad](/documents/wireframes/ipad/)
- [Wireframes Laptop](/documents/wireframes/laptop/)

<a id=the-surface>

### The Surface

- In the finalization phase, my strategy solidified with the decision to include 5 questions per difficulty level, each accompanied by a specific scoring system.
- The addition of a 10-second timer introduced an element of challenge.
- Inspired by the visual style of my previous project, I incorporated a background with opacity for a cohesive and visually appealing design.
- The project's foundation was laid by following a tutorial on YouTube, and proper credits to the tutorial creator were acknowledged.
- The strategic decision to embed a Beatles playlist aligns with the goal of making the quiz not just a test of knowledge but a holistic and enjoyable encounter for participants. This musical touch contributes to the immersive and entertaining nature of the game, fostering a connection with the iconic soundscape of The Beatles.

# User Experience

<a id=first-time-user>

### First Time User

- Quick Onboarding: The first-time user should be able to quickly understand how to play and initiate the game.
- Fun and Challenge: The game should provide both entertainment and challenge to make the initial experience enjoyable.
- Simultaneous Enjoyment: The user should be able to play the game and listen to Beatles songs concurrently for a more engaging experience.

<a id=returning-user>

### Returning User

- Score Comparison: Returning users should have the opportunity to replay the game and compare their current score with their previous performance.
- Exploration of Difficulty Levels: Users returning to the game might want to explore different difficulty levels to discover their preference.

<a id=frequent-user>

### Frequent User

- Variety in Questions: Frequent users should encounter a more diverse set of questions to maintain interest and prevent boredom.
- Expansion of Game Modes: The quiz should evolve to introduce new game modes or features to keep frequent users engaged.
- Diversification to Other Artists: As a long-term user, there might be an interest in expanding the quiz to include questions about other artists or providing links to quizzes about similar bands.
- These user experience goals ensure that the quiz caters to the needs and preferences of different types of users, offering a well-rounded and engaging experience for all.

### Design
 My main focus is on keeping things clean and simple.

* I've embraced a minimalist design using a black and white color palette.
![Color Palette](assets/images/color-palette1.png)

* For correct and incorrect I use green and red

* The font-family is set to Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, ensuring simplicity in typography.

* The deliberate use of opacity in the background images adds a touch of sophistication, maintaining an overall sense of simplicity and cleanliness.

### The Main Page 1
* The main page, like the rest of the site, is fully responsive. 
* Initiating the game automatically conceals the rules while transforming the start button into a restart button. 
* Additionally, users have the option to manually hide the rules.

* The background image across all pages is the cover of The Beatles album "Revolver." It provides a consistent visual theme throughout the entire quiz.

### The Question
* This is the question layout. Four options are presented, the timer is displayed in the top left corner, and the question number is indicated above.
* The quiz questions, as well as the answer options, are randomized, ensuring a varied and dynamic experience for users. This adds an element of unpredictability to each round of the quiz.
